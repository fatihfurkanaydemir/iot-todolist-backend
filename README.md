# TodoList Backend

This project is the backend server for todo indicator device. This backend was built with Flask, SQLite, Waitress, luma.core, pigpio, flask_cors, json.

The project is an iot device that you can put and view your todos. You can cycle through your todos by physical buttons on the device. 
Also the device has a pomodoro timer feature to efficiently schedule your study or work. There is also a button for starting and stopping this timer.
You can use timer feature even without adding a todo.

The device connects to your local wifi and it behaves as a web application. When you visit the web page served by our device,
you will see a web application. In this application, you can add todos and also you can add duedates to your todos. Also you can delete, 
mark your todos as completed or unmark them to make them uncompleted again. Changes you make in this application will be immediately synchronized with the device itself.
